<h1>Remembering and Forgetting in the Digital Era: Human Cognition, Technological Fragility, and Archival Power</h1>

<p>The rapid development of artificial intelligence and digital technology has fundamentally changed the way human thinking, memory and information interaction. Digital tools have been deeply integrated into daily life, and are gradually shifting the responsibility of cognitive tasks from humans to machines. Tasks that used to rely on memory, problem-solving ability or interpersonal interaction are now often supported or even replaced by digital platforms. These changes have raised a series of urgent issues to be discussed: the future trend of human cognition, the survival of cultural memory, and the construction of the system for managing digital knowledge. At the same time, various infrastructures supporting digital information - from metadata frameworks to algorithm systems - have a profound impact on the classification, acquisition and preservation rules of knowledge. These infrastructures are not neutral. Rather, they reflect specific cultural, political, and institutional values that determine whose voices and histories are represented, and whose are excluded, in the digital record.</p>

<p>This paper conducts research on two interrelated core themes: first, how digital technology reshapes human memory, how to generate new risks due to the vulnerability of digital information, and how to challenge the nature of human communication; second, the research focus is shifted to metadata and digital knowledge infrastructure, and explores the rights behind the classification system. Power game, the "gatekeeper" mechanism of file management, the hidden bias in algorithms, and the principles of community files, FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) and CARE (collective benefit, authoritative control, responsibility, ethical and ethical) principles Alternative plan. Comprehensive analysis shows that the digital system not only expands the cognitive ability of human beings, but also copies the existing power structure invisibly, which deeply affects what content in the digital age can be recognized, remembered and seen at the cultural level.</p>

<h2>Digital Memory and Human Reliance on Technology</h2>

<p>This part analyzes three interrelated themes and explores the intrinsic logic of the above changes: how digital dependence reshapes human memory, how the instability of digital information poses a challenge to long-term knowledge preservation, and how the rise of artificial intelligence makes human communication and cognitive autonomy more complex. Through the discussion of these levels, this article puts forward the core point: while digital technology expands the boundaries of human capabilities, it also forms constraints on it. Digital technology brings convenience and cognitive support, but it also gives rise to dual risks at the technical and cognitive levels.</p>

<h3>2.1 Digital Dependence and the Transformation of Human Memory</h3>

<p>With the rapid development of artificial intelligence and digital technology, people's dependence on memory of various applications and websites is increasing. This dependence seems to bring convenience - people no longer need to spend a lot of time to memorize or understand information. They can retrieve content by searching websites or opening applications. In many cases, human active thinking has decreased, because digital devices have assumed the function of information storage.</p>

<p>"The advent of the Internet and sophisticated algorithmic search engines has made it easy to obtain information. Nowadays, people are used to binding information to computers. When individuals expect to easily obtain a certain information in the future, their memory of the information itself will weaken and strengthen the memory of the information acquisition path. The Internet has become an important form of external memory or 'interactive memory', and information is collectively stored in a space outside the human beings themselves "(Sparrow, Liu and Wegner, 2011). This phenomenon shows that human memory strategies are changing: we are increasingly inclined to remember how to obtain information, rather than the content of the information itself. However, there is a realistic problem: in the scenario that digital storage or search tools cannot be used, some information still needs to be remembered by human beings; some knowledge cannot rely solely on digital backup; and some information must be internalized and absorbed to form long-term memory. In other words, although digital tools bring convenience, they cannot completely replace a stable internal memory system - it is this system that supports the independent survival and development of human beings without technology.</p>

<p>The increasing dependence on digital assistive tools forces us to rethink: what knowledge should be kept within the scope of human cognition? This leads to a key question: can the release of cognitive space with the help of digital devices really help us learn new skills or use thinking in a new way? Scholars have been exploring this topic, weighing the potential benefits, limitations and negative effects of digital amnesia (Lodha, 2019).</p>

<p>Interestingly, some scholars have proposed that the application of technology does not simply replace human cognition, but may reshape and expand the boundaries of thinking. "Extending mind hypothesis" believes that the mind is not limited to the physical category of the brain or even the body. On the contrary, external tools and the environment can become an integral part of the cognitive process (Clark and Chalmers, 1998). For example, when people use notebooks to record information, notebooks act as an external memory system. In this sense, cognition has broken through the physical limitations of the human body, and the interaction between the brain, body and the environment together constitutes a unified cognitive system. This view provides a new way of thinking for understanding the role of digital technology in the cognitive process, and also makes the discussion on technology dependence more complex and profound, which is worthy of further in-depth discussion.</p>

<p>It is true that with the help of external tools to assist memory, mental resources can be liberated and invested in more important and complex tasks. However, if external tools and the environment become a part of the cognitive system, human thinking activities will be subject to external conditions such as network connectivity, device updates, and continuous iterative digital formats. Once any failure occurs in these conditions, individuals may fall into the dilemma of not being able to carry out effective action. A deeper concern is that long-term reliance on external tools may weaken human judgment. If people only focus on collecting information but fail to internalize and process knowledge in depth, they will instinctively resort to external tools when they need to make decisions.</p>

<h3>2.2 Fragility of digital information</h3>

<p>While providing new cognitive support, digital technology also exposes a key shortcoming: the digital information that human beings rely on is itself unstable and highly dependent on the rapidly iterative technology system. Unlike physical carriers, digital information cannot exist independently and must rely on hardware devices, software programs, file formats and specific platform environments. Once these support systems are eliminated or fail, the digital content may become unreadable or even completely lost. In fact, the life cycle of digital resources is often much shorter than human expectations. This brings about the second core challenge - the vulnerability of digital information. With the continuous update of software and systems, old file formats are often abandoned or stopped being supported. If the file is not migrated or converted to a new format in time, precious digital information may be permanently lost. "It is difficult for technologically backward machines to maintain normal operation for a long time", which means that hardware aging will pose a major threat to the long-term accessibility of digital information, and any digital resource preservation strategy must pay attention to this (Lorie, 2001).</p>

<p>Therefore, the preservation of digital resources is crucial. Only in this way can we ensure that future scholars can obtain and learn from current research results and knowledge. However, it should be noted that saving alone cannot guarantee the long-term availability, authenticity and accessibility of digital resources, especially in the context of the continuous updating and iteration of technology and data formats (Kirchhoff, 2008). The Portico electronic archive case is a typical example of the vulnerability of digital information. At the beginning of the 21st century, RoweCom/Faxon's journal subscription service suddenly went bankrupt, resulting in many libraries unable to access paid electronic journals. This incident reveals the core shortcomings of digital resources: the digital content itself is not stable. Once the supporting platform collapses, users' access rights may be lost instantly. In response to this problem, third-party digital preservation services such as Portico were born. Its core function is to preserve electronic journals and other native digital resources for a long time to ensure that users can still access these resources even if the publisher or platform stops operating (Wittenberg et al., 2018). Since then, Potico's preservation scope has been further expanded to e-books and digital collections, which not only reflects the large scale of the problem of digital information preservation, but also reflects that the academic community has gradually realized that digital academic achievements need a long-term protection mechanism.</p>

<p>In addition, the physical media used to store digital data - CD-ROM, digital multi-function CD-ROM, hard disk, USB flash drive and even cloud storage - all have inherent limitations. Although cloud services seem convenient, their operation still depends on the operational capabilities, server stability and long-term access policies of commercial service providers. In summary, digital information is embedded in a fragile and changing ecosystem, which means that in the digital age, it is essential to develop a forward-looking and sustainable preservation strategy.</p>

<h3>2.3 Human Communication and the Limits of Machine Interaction</h3>

<p>Although artificial intelligence has shown remarkable capabilities in information processing, task execution and problem solving, machines have never been able to replace humans in the field of communication and emotional interaction. At the most core level of interpersonal relationships, no machine can truly replace real human beings.</p>

<p>Human communication and behavior are always embedded in specific situations. People's language expression, understanding and response logic depend not only on the language itself, but also on the environment, interpersonal relationships, social clues and subtle changes in the process of interaction. However, the operation of the machine follows preset rules and patterns, and its response comes from the programmatic model algorithm, not the real participation in social situations (Suchman, 2007). Therefore, machines cannot integrate into interactive situations like humans, neither understand the deep meaning of specific words at a certain moment, nor interpret the meaning behind silence. Sachman's research profoundly reveals a core fact: human communication has innated situational and social embedding, which is fundamentally beyond the reach of machines.</p>

<p>It is further revealed the limitations of machines at the emotional level. She pointed out that although machines can simulate the behavior of caring, empathetic or companionship, they do not have real emotional experiences (Arnd-Caddigan, 2015). People may project their emotions on robots or digital assistants and regard them as "partners", but this relationship is essentially just an illusion. Turk described it as "the illusion of companionship without the responsibility of friendship". This kind of interaction may bring short-term comfort, but it cannot replace real interpersonal relationships based on mutual understanding, emotional resonance and responsibility sharing.</p>

<p>Combining the above views, it can be concluded that although machines have outstanding capabilities, they cannot assume the core role of human communication. They may be able to support or imitate certain interaction patterns, but they cannot enter the social situation on which human relationships exist, let alone establish real emotional connections. With the increasing popularity of artificial intelligence interaction, it is crucial to understand the unique value of interpersonal communication to recognize the limitations of machines.</p>

<h2>Metadata, Power, and Digital Knowledge Politics</h2>

<p>Although the second part has explained the reshaping role of digital tools in cognition and communication, to fully understand these changes, we must also examine the infrastructures that organize, classify and empower access to information. The structured way of digital knowledge - relying on metadata, algorithms and preservation systems - largely determines which groups of views and histories in the digital world can be presented.</p>

<p>Therefore, the third part turns the research focus to the power game hidden in metadata and digital archives. Metadata is often regarded as a purely technical tool, but in fact it plays a strong political role: it determines the classification rules, presentation form and interpretation path of information, and deeply affects which information can enter the public's vision and which will be ignored or even forgotten. It can be seen that the construction of the metadata system is closely related to core issues such as attribution of power, historical characterization and cultural memory.</p>

<p>This chapter explores the political attributes of metadata from three key dimensions: the political nature of the classification system, the operation mechanism of metadata as a "gatekeeper", the reproduction of bias and algorithms, and emerging alternatives such as community files and new ethical frameworks. The analysis of these dimensions together reveals that digital knowledge infrastructure is by no means a value-neutral existence, but is deeply embedded in a broader social and technological power relationship.</p>

<h3>3.1 Metadata Frameworks and the Politics of Classification</h3>

<p>Metadata is often regarded as a neutral tool for describing and organizing data. However, it is proposed in the book Sorting Things Out that classification is essentially a power practice. Any classification system is not naturally formed or unvalued, but rooted in a specific historical, cultural and institutional context (Bowker and Star, 2000). This means that metadata does not passively reflect the world, but actively shapes the world.</p>

<p>When digital archives, databases or platforms decide which classification categories to adopt, how to define thematic terms, or which attributes are worth recording, they are actually restructuring the entire knowledge map. These decisions define what "important information" is, and also determine which content will be marginalized. For example, when key keywords such as gender, race or geography are missing from the metadata system, it is difficult to retrieve groups related to these dimensions, which exacerbates systemic inequality. In addition, once these structures are encoded as metadata standards, they will be difficult to challenge because of their seemingly "natural and reasonable" or "purely technical" appearance. Therefore, the metadata framework is not only a technical system, but also an important mechanism for allocating power and shaping cognitive authority.</p>

<h3>3.2 Metadata as Gatekeeping</h3>

<p>If classification is a form of power, then metadata plays the role of "gatekeeper" in practice. archives do not simply preserve the past, but actively shape "contemporary memory". In other words, archives determine how society remembers history and how future generations interpret history (Schwartz and Cook, 2002).</p>

<p>It is further expanded this view through the concept of "symbolic annihilation": when the history of certain groups is absent from archival records, they will not only disappear from the documentary records, but also be excluded from the broader social thought. Outside the elephant (Caswell, 2014). For example, the narratives of aboriginal communities, immigrant groups and marginal social movements are often difficult to enter the collection system of official institutions. It can be seen that the impact of metadata far exceeds that of information organization at the technical level - it determines which stories can be discovered, preserved and recognized, and which groups of voices will be excluded.</p>

<p>Therefore, metadata bias is by no means a simple descriptive error, but a profound reflection of structural social inequality. When marginal groups are misclassified, inadequately described or completely ignored, their presence in the digital system will become weaker. This "invisibility" not only limits people's access to its history, but also has a profound impact on contemporary policymaking, cultural identity and social legitimacy.</p>

<h3>3.3 Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Bias and Algorithm Bias</h3>

<p>In addition to metadata classification, there is also structural inequality in the digitalization process itself. Take optical character recognition (OCR) technology as an example, the accuracy of processing Asian characters, non-Latin alphabets, old-fashioned fonts and handwritten texts is far lower than the level of processing standard Western printed texts. As a result, it is more difficult for some cultural materials to be digitized, retrieved and studied, and they fall into a dilemma of digital invisibility. Such errors will also produce cumulative effects: low-quality digital data will reduce the retrieval accuracy and weaken the discoverability, thus hindering the follow-up research of relevant collections.</p>

<p>In the book Algorithms of Oppression, Noble argues that digital systems and search engines are not value-neutral; they reproduce social prejudices and often marginalize underrepresented groups in search results and digital records (Noble, 2018). Similarly, Benjamin points out that technological systems frequently encode and reinforce racial inequality under the guise of neutrality (Benjamin, 2019).</p>

<p>These cases show that digital tools and algorithms are not passive intermediaries, but actively shape the power pattern of digital knowledge. They determine which texts, cultures and history can successfully enter the digital field, and which content will be buried due to technical bias or cognitive bias. With the increasing importance of digital infrastructure in academic and public life, recognizing these prejudices is a key prerequisite for ensuring equitable access to knowledge.</p>

<p>In summary, through the study of each chapter, this paper explores how digital technology can reshape human cognition, challenge the stability of digital information, and build the rules of knowledge acquisition through the political and cultural framework contained in the metadata system. Comprehensive analysis shows that digital technology is neither a pure auxiliary tool nor a neutral infrastructure, but has a dynamic power, which deeply affects what content is remembered, how knowledge is organized, and which groups are represented in digital cultural records. The second part reveals the cognitive impact of digital dependence, the vulnerability of digital information systems, and the irreplaceability of human communication. These research conclusions emphasize that human beings need to pay attention to the cultivation of intrinsic cognitive abilities, formulate perfect preservation strategies, and soberly realize the limitations of artificial intelligence systems in terms of emotional and situational understanding. The third part points out that metadata classification, archive description practice, optical character recognition (OCR) systems and algorithms all play a key role in shaping the "visible" and "invisible" pattern of the digital world. These structures not only affect the storage and retrieval of information, but also determine which groups and views can enter cultural memory and which will be systematically excluded. The rise of community archives and the introduction of ethical frameworks such as FAIR and CARE principles provide a feasible path for building a more inclusive and fair knowledge infrastructure.</p>

<p>Ultimately, while expanding human cognitive boundaries and cultural preservation capabilities, digital technology has also brought new dependency, risk challenges and power imbalances. Critical understanding of these dynamic relationships is the key to ensuring that digital systems help rather than weaken human autonomy, diversity and memory. With the continuous development of digital technology, future research and practice must give priority to the integration of ethical design, inclusive classification system, sustainable preservation strategies and responsible technology, so as to build a digital knowledge infrastructure that can reflect and serve the needs of all groups.</p>
